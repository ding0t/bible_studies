We were able to identify a spirit of fear and a spirit of death that were tormenting her. The spirit of death came through her listening to and singing the lyrics of a song on the radio. I was relieved, but I still wasn\u2019t satisfied. I wanted to know for sure that those things, those demons that had been tormenting were all gone. Every. Last. One. Of. Them. I wanted that root cause completely gone, and I wanted evidence to prove it.</p> <p>In March of 2020, I had the opportunity to train with Don Dickerman ministries. Through Don\u2019s ministry, the Lord taught me the key that I was missing. Victoria went to them for her first full deliverance session. She had several more mini-deliverance sessions with me as she worked through the strongholds of fear and anxiety. It is not uncommon at all for people to need a few more sessions for areas that have a really big hold on their life. Through deliverance, surrender, and coaching, Victoria learned how to resist the enemy and stay in a place of freedom. Staying free is a choice just as much as receiving freedom is a choice. Sometimes, it takes little work on our end to stay free. It can take a us some time to learn how to choose freedom and keep choosing freedom.  God doesn\u2019t require us to be strong. He actually encourages all throughout scripture to rely on His strength. Much of staying free is learning how to rely on His strength to keep us free from the grips of the enemy.</p> <p>Another reference</p>","tags":["investigation","deliverance"]},{"location":"investigation/contemporary_deliverance/#don-dickerman","title":"Don Dickerman","text":"<p>https://www.liberatedliving.info/</p> <p>On demons in a believer</p> <p>Perhaps it will help you to understand and receive the truth if you can see the comparison.

If you will search scripture with Holy Spirit guidance you will see the truth and once you do you can help to liberate others. If the scripture was not clear enough on this, I would have to believe it anyway after experiencing thousands of believers being delivered of demons! One of the foremost Southern Baptist preachers in America recently was delivered of demons.</p> <p>We are the one who had the debt we could not pay and God forgave us, just wiped it away! When we refuse to forgive someone after receiving God\u2019s great forgiveness. It is the ultimate insult to God and the most severe penalty comes with it. God turns the unforgiving believer over to the tormentors. No, we don\u2019t lose our salvation, we are never disowned, but God allows demons access to our life. Don\u2019t think they will not come.

These 12 tribes are \ncalled a Mishpachah (family). They are also called a HOLY \n(6818) NATION (1471 ... goyim ... a term for Gentiles) in Exodus \n19:5. The HOUSE OF JACOB (ISRAEL) (Exodus 19:3) became a \nHOLY NATION (Exodus 19:6) at Mount Sinai when they were married to \nGod (Jeremiah 2:2-3) in the DAY of the ASSEMBLY (Kahal / Kehilat / \nEkklesia). So, the Bride of God was the nation of Israel. The nation \nof Israel were a church / Kahal / Ekklesia at Mount Sinai. \n\nSo, Biblically, the terms \"church\" and \"Israel\" are synonymous terms. \n\nAt Mount Sinai, God BETROTHED (espoused) Himself to the nation of \nIsrael / church / kahal / kehilat / Ekklesia and in doing so entered \ninto the 1st of the 2 stages in the Biblical / Jewish wedding. So, \nthe Bride of God is the church. The Bride of God is the nation of \nIsrael. The church is the nation of Israel and the nation of Israel \nis the church. \n\nThe nation of Israel / church / kahal / kehilat / Ekklesia became \ndivided after the reign of Solomon into Northern Kingdom and Southern \nKingdom. God was still called the God of Israel but his family / \nchurch / kahal / kehilat was divided. \n\nIn a more stricter definition of the word JEW, only the tribe of JUDAH is \nJewish. The other tribes are not Jewish but they are ISRAELITES. When \nthe Northern Kingdom and Southern Kingdom were divided, the Northern \nKingdom was called the HOUSE OF ISRAEL and the Southern Kingdom \nwas called the HOUSE OF JUDAH. In a more liberal definition of the \nword Jew, all those who were part of the Southern Kingdom (house of \nJudah) were called Jewish. This would include the tribes of Judah, \nBenjamin and Levi.\n\nGod cut off the Northern Kingdom from their inheritance as members of \nthe family / church / kahal / kehilat of God (Hosea 1). But through \nthe Messiah, those who were aliened from the commonwealth of Israel \nas it is written in Ephesians 2:11-12:\n\n\"Wherefore remember that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, \nwho are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the \nCircumcision in the flesh made by hands: that at that time ye were \nwithout Messiah, being aliens from the commonwealth of ISRAEL, and \nstrangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God \nin the world\"\n\nwere able by acceping Messiah to be GRAFTED BACK into the ROOT of the \nOlive tree of God (Romans 11). This promise is for BOTH the natural \nborn branches (natural born Jews) and the wild olive branches \n(natural born non-Jews) (Romans 11:17-24). \n\nSo, ISRAEL is a term given to Jacob. Jacob was the father of 12 \ntribes. Only the tribe of Judah is Jewish. In a broader sense, the \nentire Southern Kingdom was called Jewish. \n\nGod's family / church / ekklesiah is now divided into two kingdoms. \nWe call these two kingdoms today, Judaism and Christianity. Both have \npreserved certain truths of God' s Word and certain truths of His \nKingdom. Both have erred in their ways. But, God promised that one \nday His Kingdom / family / church / kahal / kehilat / Ekklesia would \nno longer be divided but that the two kingdoms would become one \nkingdom (Ezekiel 37:15-27). In order for the two kingdoms to become \none, Christianity needs to embrace the Torah and repent to God for \nbreaking it and teaching other believers in Messiah to break it. \nJudaism needs to repent and acknowledge that Yeshua/Jesus is \nMessiah. \n\nSo who is the church? It is Israel. Who is Israel? It is the church. \nWho is God's Bride? It is the church / Israel which God first entered \ninto a marriage contract and bethrothed Himself to her at Mount \nSinai. Does God still have a covenant with a physical people called \nthe Jews who do not accept Yeshua/Jesus as Messiah? Yes because\nthe covenant that God made with Abraham was physical AND spiritual. \n\nBecause the Messianic Jewish community is confused over the terms \nCHURCH and ISRAEL also, some of them teach that only Jews are the \nBride and the \"church\" (implied to mean non-Jewish believers in \nYeshua/Jesus as Messiah) are something less than Jewish believers in \nthe Kingdom of God.\n\nYet, Biblically, the church is Israel and Israel is the church and the \nchurch/Israel became a NATION of people unto God and became a \nchurch / Kahal / Kehilat / Ekklesia assembly of people unto God at \nMount Sinai when they entered into a marriage contract with God at \nMount Sinai (the first step of the two stage in the marriage process) \nand the marriage document (Ketubah) ratifying the marriage was the \nTorah. This nation of people called Israel / church / Kahal / Kehilat \n/ Ekklesia were a MIXED MULTITUDE of people (both Jew and non-Jew) \nwho came out of Egypt (Exodus 12:38) and entered into a bethothal \ncontract with God at Mount Sinai (Jeremiah 2:2-3)\n\nTherefore, the Bride of God consists of BOTH Jew and non-Jew.\n\nFor more detailed information regarding the spiritual characteristics of \nthe Bride of Messiah, I would encourage all newsgroup members to get \nmy book, \"Who is the Bride of Christ?\".  You will be blessed greatly \nby reading this book and it will clear up even more confusion in this \narea.\n</code></pre>","tags":["studies","end times","prophecy"]},{"location":"studies/psalms/","title":"Psalms","text":"<p>The Psalms were originally written by King David and similar authors.

When it falls, you shall perish in the midst of it, and you shall know that I am the LORD. 15 Thus will I spend my wrath upon the wall and upon those who have smeared it with whitewash, and I will say to you, The wall is no more, nor those who smeared it, 16 the prophets of Israel who prophesied concerning Jerusalem and saw visions of peace for her, when there was no peace, declares the Lord GOD.</p> <p>17 \u201cAnd you, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, who prophesy out of their own hearts. Prophesy against them 18 and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: Woe to the women who sew magic bands upon all wrists, and make veils for the heads of persons of every stature, in the hunt for souls! Will you hunt down souls belonging to my people and keep your own souls alive? 19 You have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, putting to death souls who should not die and keeping alive souls who should not live, by your lying to my people, who listen to lies.</p> <p>20 \u201cTherefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against your magic bands with which you hunt the souls like birds, and I will tear them from your arms, and I will let the souls whom you hunt go free, the souls like birds. 21 Your veils also I will tear off and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand as prey, and you shall know that I am the LORD. 22 Because you have disheartened the righteous falsely, although I have not grieved him, and you have encouraged the wicked, that he should not turn from his evil way to save his life, 23 therefore you shall no more see false visions nor practice divination. I will deliver my people out of your hand. And you shall know that I am the LORD.\u201d</p>","tags":["studies","deliverance","apologetics"]},{"location":"studies/test_the_spirits/#how-they-deceive","title":"How they deceive","text":"<ol> <li>They listen to their own hearts, dreams, and spirits</li> </ol>","tags":["studies","deliverance","apologetics"]},{"location":"studies/test_the_spirits/#how-to-recognise-a-false-teacher","title":"How to recognise a false teacher","text":"<ol> <li> <p>They are  irreverent</p> <p>defile the flesh, reject authority, and blaspheme the glorious ones</p> </li> <li> <p>They are self centerd</p> <p>These are grumblers, malcontents, following their own sinful desires; they are loud-mouthed boasters, showing favoritism to gain advantage.</p> </li> <li> <p>They deny Jesus in the flesh</p> <p>By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, 3 and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God.`</p> </li> </ol>","tags":["studies","deliverance","apologetics"]},{"location":"studies/trumpet/","title":"The trumpet call of God","text":"<p>The trumpet call is significant in the Bible.
