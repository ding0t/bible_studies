## tells you to seek authority

As part of soul care principal 7 - deliverance:

> Consider authority. Jesus cast out demons by authority. Jesus gave his disciples authority to drive out demons and heal the sick (Matthew 10:1). Authority is developmental. Are you developing authority? Is it demonstrated in your life? Are you utilizing the authority that you have developed to advance the Kingdom of God? How can you develop your authority further? (Note: Dr Rob Reimerâ€™s book Spiritual Authority looks at how to develop spiritual authority and can be a useful resource on this subject) What practical action steps
are you going to take to intentionally grow in spiritual authority? Read a book, like Spiritual Authority. Join a conference like the Deliverance Training Workshop. Join a ministry team in your local church. Dialog with the Holy Spirit to see if He invites you into anything specific.
