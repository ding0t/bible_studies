# Visualisiong the bible

I want to produce a visual representation of end times. 

Features include:

maybe a dict 

```py
{
Event_reference:'',
Event_title:'',
Event_type:'',
Events_before:'',
Events_after:'',
Keywords:'',
Similar_events:'',
Bible_references:'',
Associated_attributes:'',
Notes:'',
} 
```
We can structure a fair bit of that.
