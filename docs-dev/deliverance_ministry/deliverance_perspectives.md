# Things said

## Christs work is not fully complete in us now

That it is clear sin is still having an effect, and that effect includes the demon posession of Christians.

Wouldnt you want more of Jesus now if you could.

## There were no Christians at the time of Jesus earthly ministry

why - maybe to avoid a technicality regarding the evidence of no CHristians being demon posessed during that ministry and healed by Jesus

## Sin gives opening to being demonised

do not let the sun go down on your - lest you let the sun go down on your anger
