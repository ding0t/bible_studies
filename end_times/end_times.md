studies on end times

There are significant and well argued perspectives on the end times. Particularly regarding the rapture being the _harpazo_ a distinct event from the second comping, versus them being the same event referred to in scripture.

What will differentiate the two, does it matter? With all said you can be assured that the end is the same, the core promises are the same.

So - start with the core promises and texts.


# Approach

1. Review literature
1. Record all bible verses

## Rapture

### Certainty

> [John 14:1-4](https://esv.literalword.com/?q=John+14%3A1-4)
>
> 14:1 “Let not your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me. 2 In my Father’s house are many rooms. If it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you? 3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, that where I am you may be also. 4 And you know the way to where I am going.”
        
        * _Missler starts with this because_

### Imminance of the rapture

> [Matthew 24:36-44](https://esv.literalword.com/?q=Matthew+24%3A36-44)
>    
> _No One Knows That Day and Hour_
>
> 36 “But concerning that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only. 37 For as were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. 38 For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, 39 and they were unaware until the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. 40 Then two men will be in the field; one will be taken and one left. 41 Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one left. 42 Therefore, stay awake, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. 43 But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into. 44 Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.


* Imminance of the rapture
* The rapture will be pre-judgement
* The ark is prophetic of the rapture - to what extent?
*  _you must also be ready_

> [Matthew 25:1-13](https://esv.literalword.com/?q=Matthew+25%3A1-13)
> 
> _The Parable of the Ten Virgins_
>
> 25:1 “Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom. 2 Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. 3 For when the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them, 4 but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps. 5 As the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and slept. 6 But at midnight there was a cry, ‘Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.’ 7 Then all those virgins rose and trimmed their lamps. 8 And the foolish said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.’ 9 But the wise answered, saying, ‘Since there will not be enough for us and for you, go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves.’ 10 And while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut. 11 Afterward the other virgins came also, saying, ‘Lord, lord, open to us.’ 12 But he answered, ‘Truly, I say to you, I do not know you.’ 13 Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour.

* why ten? five fools, five wise
* the wise were prepared for the return of the bridegroom
* _they all became drowsy and slept_ - note the similarity with the garden of gethsamene where Jesus prayed and the disciples slept
* _they went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut_
* _watch therefore, for you do not know the day or the hour_

### The call to rapture

> [1 Thessalonians 4:15-18](https://esv.literalword.com/?q=1+Thessalonians+4%3A15-18)
>
> 15 For this we declare to you by a word from the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep. 16 For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the sound of the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. 17 Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord. 18 Therefore encourage one another with these words.

* _declare to you by a word from the Lord_
* _encourage one another with these words_
* the voice of an archangel
* the trumpet of God

> [1 Corinthians 15:51-53](https://esv.literalword.com/?q=1+Corinthians+15%3A51-53)
>
> 51 Behold! I tell you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, 52 in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we shall be changed. 53 For this perishable body must put on the imperishable, and this mortal body must put on immortality.

* _I tell you a mystery_
* Trumpet
* Imperishable
* Immortality

### 

> [2 Thessalonians 2:1-7](https://esv.literalword.com/?q=2+Thessalonians+2%3A1-7)
> 
> _The Man of Lawlessness_
>
> 2:1 Now concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered together to him, we ask you, brothers, 2 not to be quickly shaken in mind or alarmed, either by a spirit or a spoken word, or a letter seeming to be from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come. 3 Let no one deceive you in any way. For that day will not come, unless the rebellion comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction, 4 who opposes and exalts himself against every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, proclaiming himself to be God. 5 Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things? 6 And you know what is restraining him now so that he may be revealed in his time. 7 For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work. Only he who now restrains it will do so until he is out of the way.


* _Our being gatehred together_
* _that day will not come unless the rebellion comes first_ - does this mean post tribulation? NOte that there are many _day of the Lord_ events per the refernce for Psalm83 war
* _he who now restrains it will do so until he is out of the way_ - what is it that restrains the son of destruction?
