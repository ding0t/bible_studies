# Prayer

The attitude of prayer is that we are God's.

"Our Father, holy is your name, your kingdom and Your will..." Sets our attitude toward God our Father.

"Our Daily Bread" recognises that our needs are provided by God.

"Forgive our sins" God is our redeemer.

> 1 Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, 
> 2 **looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith,** who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.

## Lords Prayer

> ✝️ [Mat 6:5-15 (ESV)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/Mat/6/5-15)
>
> 5 "And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites. For they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. 
> 6 But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you. 
> 7 "And when you pray, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do, for they think that they will be heard for their many words. 
> 8 Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him. 
> 9 Pray then like this: "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. 
> 10 Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. 
> 11 Give us this day our daily bread, 
> 12 and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. 
> 13 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
> 14 For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you, 
> 15 but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.

### Nature of prayer

How does God work in a world where he has given dominion to rebelious man? God cannot legally implement his will unless we ask him to.

Prayer - is the right for God to implement his sovereignty by the request of man.

Prayer recognises the sovereignty of God and freewill of man.

Mans relationship as steward over Gods creation.
