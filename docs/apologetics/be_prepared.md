# Be prepared

Why should one study apologetics?

> ✝️ [1Peter 3:14-16 (ESV)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/1pe/3/14-16)
>
> 14 But even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake, you will be blessed. Have no fear of them, nor be troubled, **15 but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect, 16 having a good conscience, so that, when you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame.**

> ✝️ [Acts 17:11-12 (ESV)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/act/17/11-12)
>
> 11 Now these Jews were **more noble than those in Thessalonica; they received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so.** 12 Many of them therefore believed, with not a few Greek women of high standing as well as men.

What attitude should one have?

- Give reason for the hope that is in you
