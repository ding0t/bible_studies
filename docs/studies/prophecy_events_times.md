[Israel and the church](https://www.hebroots.org/hebrootsarchive/9802/980225_c.html)

Is your understanding of the church correct - you assume gentiles...

```txt
The HOUSE OF JACOB is ALL TWELVE TRIBES. These 12 tribes are 
called a Mishpachah (family). They are also called a HOLY 
(6818) NATION (1471 ... goyim ... a term for Gentiles) in Exodus 
19:5. The HOUSE OF JACOB (ISRAEL) (Exodus 19:3) became a 
HOLY NATION (Exodus 19:6) at Mount Sinai when they were married to 
God (Jeremiah 2:2-3) in the DAY of the ASSEMBLY (Kahal / Kehilat / 
Ekklesia). So, the Bride of God was the nation of Israel. The nation 
of Israel were a church / Kahal / Ekklesia at Mount Sinai. 

So, Biblically, the terms "church" and "Israel" are synonymous terms. 

At Mount Sinai, God BETROTHED (espoused) Himself to the nation of 
Israel / church / kahal / kehilat / Ekklesia and in doing so entered 
into the 1st of the 2 stages in the Biblical / Jewish wedding. So, 
the Bride of God is the church. The Bride of God is the nation of 
Israel. The church is the nation of Israel and the nation of Israel 
is the church. 

The nation of Israel / church / kahal / kehilat / Ekklesia became 
divided after the reign of Solomon into Northern Kingdom and Southern 
Kingdom. God was still called the God of Israel but his family / 
church / kahal / kehilat was divided. 

In a more stricter definition of the word JEW, only the tribe of JUDAH is 
Jewish. The other tribes are not Jewish but they are ISRAELITES. When 
the Northern Kingdom and Southern Kingdom were divided, the Northern 
Kingdom was called the HOUSE OF ISRAEL and the Southern Kingdom 
was called the HOUSE OF JUDAH. In a more liberal definition of the 
word Jew, all those who were part of the Southern Kingdom (house of 
Judah) were called Jewish. This would include the tribes of Judah, 
Benjamin and Levi.

God cut off the Northern Kingdom from their inheritance as members of 
the family / church / kahal / kehilat of God (Hosea 1). But through 
the Messiah, those who were aliened from the commonwealth of Israel 
as it is written in Ephesians 2:11-12:

"Wherefore remember that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, 
who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the 
Circumcision in the flesh made by hands: that at that time ye were 
without Messiah, being aliens from the commonwealth of ISRAEL, and 
strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God 
in the world"

were able by acceping Messiah to be GRAFTED BACK into the ROOT of the 
Olive tree of God (Romans 11). This promise is for BOTH the natural 
born branches (natural born Jews) and the wild olive branches 
(natural born non-Jews) (Romans 11:17-24). 

So, ISRAEL is a term given to Jacob. Jacob was the father of 12 
tribes. Only the tribe of Judah is Jewish. In a broader sense, the 
entire Southern Kingdom was called Jewish. 

God's family / church / ekklesiah is now divided into two kingdoms. 
We call these two kingdoms today, Judaism and Christianity. Both have 
preserved certain truths of God' s Word and certain truths of His 
Kingdom. Both have erred in their ways. But, God promised that one 
day His Kingdom / family / church / kahal / kehilat / Ekklesia would 
no longer be divided but that the two kingdoms would become one 
kingdom (Ezekiel 37:15-27). In order for the two kingdoms to become 
one, Christianity needs to embrace the Torah and repent to God for 
breaking it and teaching other believers in Messiah to break it. 
Judaism needs to repent and acknowledge that Yeshua/Jesus is 
Messiah. 

So who is the church? It is Israel. Who is Israel? It is the church. 
Who is God's Bride? It is the church / Israel which God first entered 
into a marriage contract and bethrothed Himself to her at Mount 
Sinai. Does God still have a covenant with a physical people called 
the Jews who do not accept Yeshua/Jesus as Messiah? Yes because
the covenant that God made with Abraham was physical AND spiritual. 

Because the Messianic Jewish community is confused over the terms 
CHURCH and ISRAEL also, some of them teach that only Jews are the 
Bride and the "church" (implied to mean non-Jewish believers in 
Yeshua/Jesus as Messiah) are something less than Jewish believers in 
the Kingdom of God.

Yet, Biblically, the church is Israel and Israel is the church and the 
church/Israel became a NATION of people unto God and became a 
church / Kahal / Kehilat / Ekklesia assembly of people unto God at 
Mount Sinai when they entered into a marriage contract with God at 
Mount Sinai (the first step of the two stage in the marriage process) 
and the marriage document (Ketubah) ratifying the marriage was the 
Torah. This nation of people called Israel / church / Kahal / Kehilat 
/ Ekklesia were a MIXED MULTITUDE of people (both Jew and non-Jew) 
who came out of Egypt (Exodus 12:38) and entered into a bethothal 
contract with God at Mount Sinai (Jeremiah 2:2-3)

Therefore, the Bride of God consists of BOTH Jew and non-Jew.

For more detailed information regarding the spiritual characteristics of 
the Bride of Messiah, I would encourage all newsgroup members to get 
my book, "Who is the Bride of Christ?".  You will be blessed greatly 
by reading this book and it will clear up even more confusion in this 
area.
