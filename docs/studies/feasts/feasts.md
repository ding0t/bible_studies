!!! quote "A shadow of things to come"

    It was the intention of God, and well understood by the Sanhedrin of Israel, that the watch for the Feast of Trumpets, was a rehearsal for the time when this feast would be fully realized. In Colossians 2:17, Paul describes these rehearsals as “a shadow of the good things to come.”
