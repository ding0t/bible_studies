# Idolatry

Studies exploring the nature of idolatry. The initial question was "Is idolatry the worship of demons?"

> ✝️ [Col 3:5 (ESV)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/Col/3/5)
>
> 5 Put to death therefore what is earthly in you: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry.

Idolatry is clear in the Bible it relates to the heart more than the object. There is no detail in that which is an empty object
being a demon or worship of a demon. Indeed that is one of the laughable matters that they have no form of themselves but are empty and reflect the sinful heart of man.

Idolatry is the forsaking of God in the heart. The deep seated satisfaction of being created to know God
is replaced with the emptiness of a thing that we set up as a god that we control.

Our gods are so small they can even be wooden.

> ✝️ [Eze 14:3 (ESV)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/Eze/14/3)
>
> 3 "Son of man, these men have taken their idols into their hearts, and set the stumbling block of their iniquity before their faces. Should I indeed let myself be consulted by them?
