# Deliverance ministry

## Common themes

* Mixed up with other contemporary therapies
* There is 'more' to access of God than the work of Christ


## Observation

* It seems to promote a works based faith:

    > This is the preparatory work to do deliverance, it is not deliverance:
    > * all your confessions are current
    > * reveal family secrets
    > * Is there historical addiction opr abuse?
    > * Is there occult activity?

## Is the teaching demonic?

* It is not biblical, but twists biblical principals
* they do ackowledge Jesus died on the cross 

    > Approprate the work of Jesus on the cross



# A demon cannot demonise (posess) a Christian

There is no support in the Word for a Christian to be under the control of a demon.

Although delivereance ministry teaches 'demonised' versus posessed, the term is a clear control that is closer to the common sense of 'posessed'. 

The term 'demonised' does not refer to demon oppression. The work of a demon against a Christian.

## Antithesis

1. There is no case of an evil spirit being driven out of a believer
1. The Word is clear that a Christian has the Spirit, and the posession of God. The body is a temple of the Holy Spirit.
1. The empty house analogy is clear that something must dwell in a person. The house either has the Holy Spirit or a demon.

## The person as a temple for a spirit

*there is place in a person made for the Holy Spirit, but when empty is a place demons can dwell*

> ✝️ [Matthew 12:43-44 (ESV)](https://esv.literalword.com/?q=Matthew+12%3A43-44)
>
> 43 “When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, but finds none. 44 Then it says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came.’ And when it comes, it finds the house empty, swept, and put in order.

## We are Gods posession

> ✝️ [Ephesians 1:14-14 (ESV)](https://esv.literalword.com/?q=Ephesians+1%3A14-14)
>
> 14 who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it, to the praise of his glory.


> ✝️ [1Peter 2:9-9 (ESV)](https://esv.literalword.com/?q=1Peter+2%3A9-9)
>
> 9 But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.

> ✝️ [1Corinthians 3:23-23 (ESV)](https://esv.literalword.com/?q=1Corinthians+3%3A23-23)
>
> 23 and you are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s.

## The Holy Spirit is in us

*know the Spirit in you vs the world*

> ✝️ [1John 4:4-4 (ESV)](https://esv.literalword.com/?q=1John+4%3A4-4)
>
> 4 Little children, you are from God and have overcome them, for he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.

*we are a new creation*

> ✝️ [2Corinthians 5:17-18 (ESV)](https://esv.literalword.com/?q=2Corinthians+5%3A17-18)
>
> 7 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. 18 All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation;

## We are delivered

> ✝️ [Colossians 1:12-13 (ESV)](https://esv.literalword.com/?q=Colossians+1%3A12-13)
>
> 12 giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in light. 13 He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son,

## Where can a demon demonise?

*not the body*

> ✝️ [1Corinthians 6:19-20 (ESV)](https://esv.literalword.com/?q=1Corinthians+6%3A19-20)
>
> 19 Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, 20 for you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body.

*not the spirit*

> ✝️ [1Corinthians 6:17-17 (ESV)](https://esv.literalword.com/?q=1Corinthians+6%3A17-17)
>
> 17 But he who is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit with him.

*Soul posession is against the nature of demon posession. Consider the physical posession of the pigs and the physical wandering of a spirit*

> ✝️ [Mark 5:12-12 (ESV)](https://esv.literalword.com/?q=Mark+5%3A12-12)
>
> 12 and they begged him, saying, “Send us to the pigs; let us enter them.”




## Gifts

*these are gifts to edify the church. THere is no gift to exorcise believers*

> ✝️ [1Corinthians 12:1-11 (ESV)](https://esv.literalword.com/?q=1Corinthians+12%3A1-11)
>
> Spiritual Gifts
> 12:1 Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be uninformed. 2 You know that when you were pagans you were led astray to mute idols, however you were led. 3 Therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking in the Spirit of God ever says “Jesus is accursed!” and no one can say “Jesus is Lord” except in the Holy Spirit.
> 
> 4 Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit; 5 and there are varieties of service, but the same Lord; 6 and there are varieties of activities, but it is the same God who empowers them all in everyone. 7 To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good. 8 For to one is given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom, and to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same Spirit, 9 to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, 10 to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another the ability to distinguish between spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. 
> 
> 11 All these are empowered by one and the same Spirit, who apportions to each one individually as he wills.

# How do we account for outward signs in deliverance ministry

The fact of outward signs demonstrated by Christians during deliverance ministry is real. 

Concerningly, it is likely that Christians can delve unwittingly in [sorcery](/deliverance_ministry/sorcery.md)
