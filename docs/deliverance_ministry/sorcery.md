## Reasoning

Where Christians cannot be posessed, and The Christian manifestation in deliverance is either:

1. true
    1. The person is not a christian
    1. The manifestaion is of a demon - 
    1. The manifestation is a hypnotism - of sorcery
1. false
    1. The manifestation is a charlitain, a deceit
    1. The manifestation is similar to hypnotism

**If it is true manifestation of a true christian, the means is by sorcery.**

Is there evidence of those in deliverance ministry of Christians involved in sorcery?

Are deliverance ministers listening and taught to listen to the words of demons?

# What is sorcery

It is the pursuit of ungodly powers. Sorcery is explicitly forbidden by God for us.

Why; in looking into deliverance ministry, there is actual manifestation in professing Christians, what drives this event?

> *Barnabas and Saul on Cyprus*

> 4 So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed to Cyprus. 5 When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. And they had John to assist them. 6 When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they came upon a certain magician, a Jewish false prophet named Bar-Jesus. 7 He was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence, who summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God. 8 But Elymas the magician (for that is the meaning of his name) opposed them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith. 9 But Saul, who was also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him 10 and said, “You son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, full of all deceit and villainy, will you not stop making crooked the straight paths of the Lord? 11 And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind and unable to see the sun for a time.” Immediately mist and darkness fell upon him, and he went about seeking people to lead him by the hand. 12 Then the proconsul believed, when he saw what had occurred, for he was astonished at the teaching of the Lord.

# The bible explicitly forbids sorcery

https://sharonbpc.wordpress.com/2012/08/19/does-the-bible-warn-against-hypnotism/

## Christians are warned against sorcery


# Why

Main reason it is either no- or really bad - Jesus said a house divided against itself cannot stand when under the claim by satan you drv eout demons.

> *Blasphemy Against the Holy Spirit*
>
> 22 Then a demon-oppressed man who was blind and mute was brought to him, and he healed him, so that the man spoke and saw. 23 And all the people were amazed, and said, “Can this be the Son of David?” 24 But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, “It is only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that this man casts out demons.” 25 Knowing their thoughts, he said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and no city or house divided against itself will stand. 26 And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand? 27 And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges. 28 But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. 29 Or how can someone enter a strong man’s house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? Then indeed he may plunder his house. 30 Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters. 31 Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. 32 And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.
