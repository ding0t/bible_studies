# About

These are personal bible study notes to help make sure I learn, and share that learning.
We have the bible, an integrated message to us of Gods work with humanity.
It is foolish to ignore this message.

These notes have a focus on:

- [x] Understanding faith in God as described in the Old and New testaments of the Bible, in order to be prepared to explain the truth in love.
- [x] Bible end times, because the Bible says we are in the last days, and it is important to know where we stand with God before terrible days come, and we are not prepared.
- [x] Investigating common issues in order to understand them
- [x] Starting the journey of learning biblical Hebrew
- [x] Getting some sermon/teaching ideas together as they come
