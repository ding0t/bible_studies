## Numbers

Hebrew does not have a separate set of characters to represent numbers (like the English 1, 2, 3, etc.). Rather, each letter of the Hebrew alphabet represents a numerical value. 

- The consonants א through ט  represent the numbers 1–9. 
- Consonants י through צ represent numbers 10–90 in multiples of 10 (10, 20, 30, etc.). 
- And ק  through ת represent the numbers 100, 200, 300 and 400 (שׂ and שׁ both represent 300).
