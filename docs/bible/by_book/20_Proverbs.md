## Daily verse reflections

Proverbs has 30 chapters. Read one chapter a day for a month.
The following are favourite verses and insigts from daily reading

### Book ONe

??? note "Proverbs 01 - The way of the Righteous and Wicked"

    ✝️ [Pr 1:5 (ESV)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/Pr/1/5)
    "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge;
    fools despise wisdom and instruction.

    - Our introduction to a binary message on the way of wisdom
    - Life with wisdom
    - Death without wisdom
    - Wisdom can clearly be chosen by all, it is never withheld from those who seek.

??? success "Proverbs 08 - The blessings of Wisdom"

    ✝️ [Pro 8:35-36 (ESV)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/Pro/8/35-36)
    "35 For whoever finds me finds life and obtains favor from the LORD, 
    36 but he who fails to find me injures himself; all who hate me love death."

    - The clear blessing of Wisdom
    - Death is the outcome from not pursuing Wisdom


??? abstract "Proverbs 09 - The way of Wisdom"

    ✝️ [Pro 9:10 (ESV)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/Pro/9/10)
    "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom,
    and the knowledge of the Holy One is insight."

    This verse makes clear that wisdom is dependant on knowing God and His nature.
    It shows the first step on the right path to life.

- :fontawesome-solid-book-bible: __Wisdom is following Gods Laws__

    ---

    And these laws are not a burdon, but life

- :material-scale-balance: __Any path away form God is death__

    ---

    The path apart from God is:
    - selfish
    - death
    - deceptive
