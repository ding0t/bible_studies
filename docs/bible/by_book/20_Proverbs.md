## Daily verse reflections

Proverbs has 30 chapters. Read one chapter a day for a month.
The following are favourite verses and insigts from daily reading

### Section One - parents instruction to Solomon

??? note "Proverbs 01 - The way of the Righteous and Wicked"

    ✝️ [Pr 1:5 (ESV)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/Pr/1/5)
    "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge;
    fools despise wisdom and instruction.

    - Our introduction to a binary message on the way of wisdom
    - Life with wisdom
    - Death without wisdom
    - Wisdom can clearly be chosen by all, it is never withheld from those who seek.

??? success "Proverbs 08 - The blessings of Wisdom"

    ✝️ [Pro 8:35-36 (ESV)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/Pro/8/35-36)
    "35 For whoever finds me finds life and obtains favor from the LORD, 
    36 but he who fails to find me injures himself; all who hate me love death."

    - The clear blessing of Wisdom
    - Death is the outcome from not pursuing Wisdom


??? abstract "Proverbs 09 - The way of Wisdom"

    ✝️ [Pro 9:10 (ESV)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/Pro/9/10)
    "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom,
    and the knowledge of the Holy One is insight."

    This verse makes clear that wisdom is dependant on knowing God and His nature.
    It shows the first step on the right path to life.

### Section two - Proverbs of Solomon

??? danger "Proverbs 10 - Proverbs of Solomon "

    ✝️ [Pro 10:16-17 (ESV)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/Pro/10/16-17)
    "16 The wage of the righteous leads to life, the gain of the wicked to sin. 
    17 Whoever heeds instruction is on the path to life, but he who rejects reproof leads others astray."

    - Listening to reproof and instruction is wise.
    - To reject reproof is to cause not only yourself to fall, but also others

??? example "Proverbs 11 - Contrasting the way of the wicked and godly"

    ✝️ [Pro 11:22 (ESV)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/Pro/11/22)
    "Like a gold ring in a pig's snout is a beautiful woman without discretion."

    - Such a contrast to the godly woman of Proverbs 30. 
    - Do not be deceived by outward appearnaces

    ✝️ [Pro 11:16 (ESV)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/Pro/11/16)
    A gracious woman gets honor,and violent men get riches."

    - A sound contrast to v22. the gracious woman is honored, but godly honor would be implied
    - Violence  may appear to bring riches, but they are worldly and rotten, esp in contrast to godly honor.

    ✝️ [Pro 11:28 (ESV)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/Pro/11/28)
    "Whoever trusts in his riches will fall, but the righteous will flourish like a green leaf."

    - Confirming the emptiness of worldly riches in its value toward eternal life.
    - Righteousness is what is valued for eternal life, the attitudes of the heart to God and our neighbour.

??? tip "The wise tongue and ear"

    ✝️ [Pro 15:4 (ESV)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/Pro/15/4)
    "A gentle[healing] tongue is a tree of life,
    but perverseness in it breaks the spirit."

    ✝️ [Pro 15:28 (ESV)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/Pro/15/28)
    "The heart of the righteous ponders how to answer,
    but the mouth of the wicked pours out evil things."

    ✝️ [Pro 15:31 (ESV)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/Pro/15/31)
    "The ear that listens to life-giving reproof
    will dwell among the wise."

    A whole chapter on how the attitude of the heart of the wise
    will bear words of good fruit, and ears that listen to instruction and 
    reproof.

    Listen with love. Ponder and respond in love.

??? success "The most excellent way"

    ✝️ [Pro 16:20 (ESV)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/Pro/16/20)
    "Whoever gives thought to the word[or matter] will discover good,
    and blessed is he who trusts in the LORD."
    
    - Proverbs 16 is central in position and in thought.
    - The benefit of wisdom is established by the Lord.
    - The wise are guided by the Lord

??? question "How can I understand my way?"

    ✝️ [Pro 20:24 (ESV)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/Pro/20/24)
    "A man’s steps are from the LORD;
    how then can man understand his way?"

    - cf ✝️ [Psa 37:23 (ESV)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/Psa/37/23)
    - cf ✝️ [Isa 55:9 (ESV)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/Isa/55/9)
    - It is a very blessed thing if the LORD directs your path, even steps.
    - We may think our paths should go a certain way, but as we submit to the LORD, those ways become so much more assured.
    - As we pray always; "your will be done"; we eagerly seek the LORDS will to direct our paths
    - cf ✝️ [Deu 31:8 (ESV)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/Deu/31/8)
    - cf ✝️ [Psa 139:1-12 (ESV)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/Psa/139/1-12)
    - cf ✝️ [Rom 8:28 (ESV)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/Rom/8/28)
