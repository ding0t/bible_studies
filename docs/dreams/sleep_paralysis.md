# Sleep Paralysis Dreams

Experienced by many

Around 2006 I experienced it most convincingly:

- very heavy feeling of evil crushing me
- no way to shout
- My wife woke and said she saw an angel over top of me

## Interpretation

- The weight was evil, felt evil, felt suffocating
- The weight was a real and externally observable presence
- The presence wanted to corrupt thoughts
- The presence was able to corrupt dreams, to tempt

## Scripture

> ✝️ [1Co 10:13 (ESV)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/1Co/10/13)
>
> No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.
