# The monster in the man

03 April 2008

THere was a man tied up, who looked as if he was or had died because of the amount of wounds to his head.

He was dark hair, thin faced, somewhat pale and ill to look at. His mouth had surgery where something, 
some flesh, was stiched over it to keep him quiet. Yet half of it had been cut, in the middle vertically, so he could speak.

What he said was, or did not seem important, yet as he was speaking a monster would transfigure out of him. 
A demon, with a foul mouth, sharp teeth, and a devouring attitude. Its attitude was clearly to kill and destroy.
It made you sick to hear it speak.

At times the man would regain control. And the mouth would transfigure back to the stiched up one from the monster.
No longer the sharp teeth of destruction.

However, it was not long and the demon would come back.

Then it was as if the demon had matured. Was strong enough to break the bonds that held it.
Then it went out to devour. Everything hid.

It was a fearful monster. Yet everyone hid knowing its time would pass.

The hiding place was inside an old house. THere I his with something. We were avoiding the horror of the 
monster. yet not afraid os what would happen to us, so much as waiting for its end.

Even knowing the monster-demon had no rule. It was still an overwhelming prescence of evil. It penetrated all around.

> [2Pe 2:9-11 ESV] 9 then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment, 10 and especially those who indulge in the lust of defiling passion and despise authority. Bold and willful, they do not tremble as they blaspheme the glorious ones, 11 whereas angels, though greater in might and power, do not pronounce a blasphemous judgment against them before the Lord.
