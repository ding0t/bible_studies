# The Deceiver

10 June 2023

There was a thing so evil its only job was to deceive.

If you looked away from it, you forgot that was its job. It then told you a horrifying lie.

It appeared innocent as a child. But it was evil that consumed all it deceived. It made people kill themselves
and each other through turning people on each other and themselves by fear.

It would state its objective, which seems so horrid as to never be real. Then you look away, and a scenario is 
playing out that is so real. And yet is the deception.

It said it will make you all commit a crime. And then you look away from it. Then everyone has turned to kill each other
due to mistrust. All deceived by the machine to either protect someone or themselves. Under control of fear brought on by a lie.

The machine cannot be killed. I say a machine - because although it appeared as a child, it was no human. When its deceit is
remembered, it resets and starts a new lie. Just as dreadful and fear driven as the last.

The only escape was to leave it alone, and possibly not to listen to the words it spoke. Or the actions of its \
innocent looking child self. It was a wolf dressed as a sheep. It destroyed all around by deceit and fear.

## Interpretation

- The thing that lies is Satan and his servants. Even if it is the anti-christ, the principal is still relevant now
- The thing that lies appears innocent
- The lie may seem unreasonable when spoken, but as soon as sight of the truth is lost, the lie bears ist fruit
- The lie causes men the fear and turn on each other

## Scripture

> ✝️ [John 8:44 (ESV)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/John/8/44)
>
> You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father’s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies.

> ✝️ [2Co 11:14 (ESV)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/2Co/11/14)
>
> And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.

> ✝️ [Jas 1:15 (ESV)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/Jas/1/15)
>
> 15 Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin, and sin when it is fully grown brings forth death.
