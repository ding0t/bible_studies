# Contemporary deliverance in Christianity

The following studies into contemporary deliverance ministris was borne from a desire to understand the common teachings, and the heart of the proponents.

This is not about studying the casting of demons from those not filled with the Holy Spirit
But rather, of those who say that a Christian can be 'demonised'. Somewhat of a play on the greek wording to avoid the common translation of ' demon possession'

To summarise findings the following quote did quite well:

!!! quote

    'The bible fades into obscurity as the church promotes false and heretical teachings. Where miracles are emphasised, Jesus is denied' [quote source](https://gospelliving.blogspot.com/2012/05/re-pastor-dayna-muldoon-exposed.html)

Some quotes of contemporary deliverance:

> He may speak things that seem strange and unusual to you but it is the holy spirit.
>
> You are receiving a fresher and newer annointing.

The following is a collection on contemporary deliverance ministries, just found by search and pivots on terms.

The objective was just to provide direct quotes of significance, versus an assessment. The reader can assess for themselves. 

Overall, time is better spent reading God's Word. But this is useful if it is impacting your life.

[Commentary on mechanics](https://www.andreabygrace.com/blog/deliverancemisconceptions)

> Eventually, the Lord guided me to lead my daughter through deliverance from spiritual oppression enough to get her functioning again. We were able to identify a spirit of fear and a spirit of death that were tormenting her. The spirit of death came through her listening to and singing the lyrics of a song on the radio. I was relieved, but I still wasn’t satisfied. I wanted to know for sure that those things, those demons that had been tormenting were all gone. Every. Last. One. Of. Them. I wanted that root cause completely gone, and I wanted evidence to prove it.

> In March of 2020, I had the opportunity to train with Don Dickerman ministries. Through Don’s ministry, the Lord taught me the key that I was missing. Victoria went to them for her first full deliverance session. She had several more mini-deliverance sessions with me as she worked through the strongholds of fear and anxiety. It is not uncommon at all for people to need a few more sessions for areas that have a really big hold on their life. Through deliverance, surrender, and coaching, Victoria learned how to resist the enemy and stay in a place of freedom. Staying free is a choice just as much as receiving freedom is a choice. Sometimes, it takes little work on our end to stay free. It can take a us some time to learn how to choose freedom and keep choosing freedom.  God doesn’t require us to be strong. He actually encourages all throughout scripture to rely on His strength. Much of staying free is learning how to rely on His strength to keep us free from the grips of the enemy.

> Perhaps it will help you to understand and receive the truth if you can see the comparison. As long as you remain blind to the truth you will be subject to deception and control. It is difficult to combat an enemy you don’t know you have. If you will search scripture with Holy Spirit guidance you will see the truth and once you do you can help to liberate others. If the scripture was not clear enough on this, I would have to believe it anyway after experiencing thousands of believers being delivered of demons! One of the foremost Southern Baptist preachers in America recently was delivered of demons.
>
> We are the one who had the debt we could not pay and God forgave us, just wiped it away! When we refuse to forgive someone after receiving God’s great forgiveness. **It is the ultimate insult to God and the most severe penalty comes with it. God turns the unforgiving believer over to the tormentors. No, we don’t lose our salvation, we are never disowned, but God allows demons access to our life.** Don’t think they will not come. They do and they have a God given right to be there as long as there is unforgiveness.

### Tells you to seek authority

As part of soul care principal 7 - deliverance:

> Consider authority. Jesus cast out demons by authority. Jesus gave his disciples authority to drive out demons and heal the sick (Matthew 10:1). Authority is developmental. Are you developing authority? Is it demonstrated in your life? Are you utilizing the authority that you have developed to advance the Kingdom of God? How can you develop your authority further? (Note: Dr Rob Reimer’s book Spiritual Authority looks at how to develop spiritual authority and can be a useful resource on this subject) What practical action steps
are you going to take to intentionally grow in spiritual authority? Read a book, like Spiritual Authority. Join a conference like the Deliverance Training Workshop. Join a ministry team in your local church. Dialog with the Holy Spirit to see if He invites you into anything specific.
